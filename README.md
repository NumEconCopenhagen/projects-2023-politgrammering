This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. We make a variety of models where a male and a female in a household allocate the hours of work in the market and at home between, them given their comparative advantages
2. Data project. We fetch data from "Energi Data Service" for Denmark in March 2023. We look at consumption and prices in three different sectors: "Single family homes", "Chemical industry" and "retail"
3. Model project. In the model project we simulate the Malthus model where higher income raises fertility so that in the long term technology shocks increase the population and income stagnates
4. Examination project. The project contains three problems 1. We maximize a utility function for a model with taxation and government consumption. 2. We solve a model with labor cost adjustment. 3. We find a global optimizer with refined muliti-start.
