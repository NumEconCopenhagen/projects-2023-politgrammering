# Model Project
Our project is titled The Malthus Model. The model describes economies that have yet to go through the demographic transition. In this model, if technological innovation cause an increase in income per person, fertility increases. The population rises, and a larger population shares the same amount of land with decreasing returns to scale which subsequently causes a decrease in income per person.

In the standard model, it is assumed that the death rate decreases in income; however, we work with a simpler model where the death rate is fixed. 
The fertility decrease with the lower income per person til a new equilibrium is reached where the fertility and death rate are equal, and income per person stagnates.

In this paper, we set up a main model and then introduce an exogenous positive technological shock. In addition, we add a positive trend in technology.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
