# Data analysis project
Our project is titled **Electricity prices and consumption in Denmark** and is about electricity prices and consumption in Denmark in March 2023. In the analysis we look at three different sectors: "Single family homes", "Chemical industry" and "retail". 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. ConsumptionDE35Hour.csv (*https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/ConsumptionDE35Hour*) 
2. Elspotprices.csv (*https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/Elspotprices*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
