# Inaugural project
In this project we simulate an economic model for the maximazation problem of households considering a male and female with respect to their work in the market and at home. Here we find that given an equal ability that both male and female should split their work effot equally between household and market work. However, if the abilities differ the gender with the best ability in a certain type of work should mainly work in that market. When the elasticity of substitution increases this effect  becomes larger such that men and women choose to substitute towards where they are most effective even with slight increases in ability.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
