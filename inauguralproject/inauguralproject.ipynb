In question 2 and 3 we assumed alpha=0.5 and sigma=1, and we get beta1=-0.464 and beta=0.0006. We get negative estimates og beta1 regardless of the values of alpha and sigma, wich makes sense. The results indicate that alpha should take a value which is larger than 0.5 from  beta0. It is estimated from the given values of sigma and alpha, that sigma should be under 1 when looking at beta 1, but it is possible that it is over 1. "
